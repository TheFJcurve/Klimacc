# Klimacc

The essence of an API-based climate awareness software. Allows the user to check the climatic conditions of their area, any potential natural disaster, and all the compatible renewable energy sources.

Plans for the project include the ability to upload a picture or video of natural disasters directly all over social media at the click of a button, an improved interactive system, and a larger database of disasters and renewable resources.
