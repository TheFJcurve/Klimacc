# Klimacc

Essence of an API based climate awareness software. Allows the user to check the climatic conditions of their area, any potential natural disaster and all the compatible renewable energy sources.

Future plans for the project include ability to upload a picture or video of natural disaster directly all over the social media on the click of a button, improved interactive system and a larger database of disasters and renewable recources.
